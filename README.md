# Biodiverse mac build

Biodiverse is a tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, trait and matrix-based (e.g. genetic distance) relationships, as well as related environmental and temporal variations.

This repo is for the mac build scripts, the bulk of which were developed by Jason Mumbulla (@jmumbulla).
